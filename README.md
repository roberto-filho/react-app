# Bank transaction utility app

## Overview

This app is the frontend of an unfinished utility app whose main goal is to read my own personal bank transactions and sort them into categories.

It has been bootstrapped using `create-react-app` npm package (as you can see on top) and uses the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com). library for the components.

## Main screen
The main screen just shows two buttons:
* **Choose file**
* **Upload file**

It thens uploads the file and shows the transactions contained in it.

## Tags screen
There is also a screens that shows the tags (_categories_) that are in the system, pretty basic.
